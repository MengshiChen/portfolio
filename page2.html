    <div class="word"> <p class="description">Here is a form of "glitch art" I did. The original photo was taken on my IPhone three years ago, and it was the first officially digital artwork that I took. I edited in Audacity and it came out a nice contrast in the middle.</p></div>

In this video, I used premiere pro to edit, and recorded my own footages. I think arts are surrounding, so we just need to record and find them.  </p></p> </div>

      <div class="word"> <p class="description">This audio is a combination of three different audio recordings I made myself. They are the sound of running water, the sound of rocks colliding and the sound of ATM. One day, when I sat near by the fountain, I got inspired. I designed to make an audio, which is peaceful and natural. Then this audio was born. I combined them with Audacity and convert it from iTunes.</p></p>

Because I want to create an interesting and attractive art, I based on my passed project to create the Cubes website.  At the first pages, the cubes will rotate by themselves and if you find the green cubes, you can click it. Each cube will be an exit website for my previous project. The second page is the cubes are changing color by itself which I used webkit-animation to achieve my goal. The third page is a movement animation of 4 cubes, which I also used webkit-animation and keyframes to set it.</p>
