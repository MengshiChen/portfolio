In my works, I used audacity to glitch my photos and combine my voice, photoshop to make my posters and premiere pro to edit my video. I also worked with my teammates to complete our net art with code and made a small game with p5.js. All these works I made are based on the projects of the class, but each one is my own subjective opinion. In my glitch art, I wanted to use this photo as a starting point for my DMA, because it was the first digital media art I had ever been exposed to. In the sound work, I chose my own recorded sound to synthesize a brand new sound source. My poster is intended to express my views on the proliferation of guns in America. In net art and mini-games, my teammates and I wanted to express our different experiences of social software and life in different ways.<br>
In our p5js project, our inspiration comes from Pokemon and Mario games. We hope our audience can participate in our games, so we want to make a combined game with what we have learned. In this project, we found available image resources on the web and resized them in Photoshop. I was responsible for finding available sound sources on freesound and exporting them using the convert knowledge I learned in the sound project. Since we didn't know how to add sound to p5js, we looked it up online. In this project, my teammates and I completed all the work and experiments respectively.
